<p>I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...
</p>
<ol>
<li> HTML is cool </li>
<li> CSS is cooler </li>
<li> JS is the best </li>
</ol>

<h2>What do you need to create a website? Not much!</h2>
<ul>
  <li> A computer (always a good start)</li>
  <li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
  <li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
  <li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>
</html>
